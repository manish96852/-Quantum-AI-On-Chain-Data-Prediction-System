## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- Required packages (install via `pip install -r requirements.txt`)

### Installation

1. Clone repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the Examples

Project mein 3 example files hain:

1. **Simple Example** - Basic quantum simulation:
   ```
   python simple_example.py
   ```

2. **Extended Example** - Complete system simulation with all components:
   ```
   python extended_example.py
   ```

3. **Full Example** (needs complex setup) - Advanced implementation with actual API connections:
   ```
   python full_example.py
   ```

## 📚 System Architecture

Is system ka architecture modular hai, jisme har component independently kaam kar sakta hai ya phir integrated system ke roop mein bhi:

1. **Quantum Circuit** (`quantum_predictor/quantum_circuit.py`) - Quantum computing operations
2. **Blockchain Integration** (`quantum_predictor/blockchain_integration.py`) - On-chain data fetching
3. **Prediction Engine** (`quantum_predictor/prediction_engine.py`) - Main prediction logic
4. **Psychological Analysis** (`quantum_predictor/psychological_analysis.py`) - Human behavior prediction
5. **Disease & Weather Engine** (`quantum_predictor/disease_weather_engine.py`) - Specialized predictions
6. **Smart Contract Integration** (`quantum_predictor/enhanced_blockchain.py`) - On-chain validation

## ⚠️ Limitations and Notes

- Simplified examples (`simple_example.py` and `extended_example.py`) actual quantum computing ya blockchain connections use nahi karte - sirf simulation hai
- Full example (`full_example.py`) complex dependencies require karta hai aur API keys needed hain
- All predictions are probabilistic in nature

## 🔮 Future Development

Future mein system mein yeh enhancements add kiye jayenge:
- Advanced quantum circuits with higher qubit count
- Direct integration with more blockchain networks
- More sophisticated behavioral models
- Enhanced disease spread prediction algorithms
- UI interface for easier interaction
